#  P2P Communication System (Cybersec + Blockchain + Networking)

## Overview
This project is a **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication System** that enables two clients to communicate directly without routing all traffic through a central server.  
We use:
- **WebRTC** for real-time peer-to-peer connections
- **Blockchain (Ethereum)** for **decentralized identity and peer discovery**
- **A lightweight signaling server** only for exchanging connection info (not for relaying data)

This ensures secure, private, and decentralized communicationâ€”ideal for messaging. 

##  Features
âœ… Blockchain-based **decentralized peer discovery**  
âœ… Wallet-based **identity management** (MetaMask)  
âœ… Direct **WebRTC peer-to-peer communication** (data channel)  
âœ… **Signaling server** (WebSockets) for offer/answer exchange only  
âœ… Real-time **chat messaging** between peers  
âœ… Future: **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** with key exchange
